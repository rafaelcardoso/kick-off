# Kick-off

Kick-off is a web project prototype that's based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://www.html5boilerplate.com/) and [Pure](purecss.io). This tool was developed for those who need a boilerplate oriented to modules (css and js) to start a new project.

## Installation

1. Setup a PHP enviroment (PHP is only used to include partials pages)
2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
3. Install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
4. Install [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/)
5. Install [Bower](http://bower.io/)
6. Install [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
7. Install [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)
8. Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/zipball/master)
9. Move the extracted directory to your PHP environment
10. Run `npm install` from your `kick-off/` root folder to install the development dependencies
11. Run `bower install` from your `kick-off/` root folder to install the javascript dependencies
12. Finally, enjoy :)

## Usage

1. Before editing any `.html`, `.css` or `.js` file run `grunt w` from your `kick-off/` root folder to Grunt watch the modifications and compile, lint and uglify your files automatically.

#### [src/assets/img/sprites](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/img/sprites)

Contains the images that compose sprites. Everytime that you add images in this folder, edit and save any .scss file, Compass will generate a new sprite automatically and will put him in the [src/assets/img](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/img) folder, overwriting the old image.

#### [src/assets/js](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/js)

Contains all the javascript files by your application.

#### [src/assets/js/modules](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/js/modules)

Contains all the javascript modules. Everytime that you save any .js file in this folder, grunt will hint, concat all the modules in a new file, hint the concatenated file and uglify him. The concatenated file will be put in the [src/assets/js](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/js) folder, overwriting the old file.

#### [src/assets/sass](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/sass/)

Contains all the `.sass` and `.scss` files. In this folder exists a file called `main.scss`, this file is responsible for call all modules of your style sheet architecture. Everytime that you edit and save any `.sass` or `.scss` file in this folder or subfolders, Sass will compile a new css file called 'main.css' and put him on the folder [src/assets/css](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/css), overwriting the old file.

#### [src/assets/sass/components](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/assets/sass/components/)

Contains third-party libs and frameworks that you want to use, like font-awesome.

#### [src/pages](https://github.com/rafaelcardoso/kick-off/tree/master/src/pages)
